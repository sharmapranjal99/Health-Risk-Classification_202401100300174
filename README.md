Health Risk Classification involves using artificial intelligence to predict an individual's health risk levelâ€”typically categorized as low, medium, or high. This prediction is based on factors such as BMI (Body Mass Index), exercise habits, and dietary patterns. By analyzing these inputs, AI models can help identify people at risk of developing health issues, enabling early intervention, personalized health recommendations, and better preventive care strategies.
